# Day 2 — The AI Ecosystem: Data Scientists, ML Engineers & AI Engineers

## 🎯 Goal
Understand the three major roles behind modern AI systems, how they collaborate, and why the **AI Engineer** is becoming the bridge between data science and product engineering.

---

## 🧭 Ecosystem Overview

| Role | Core Focus | Typical Skills | Main Output |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Data Scientist** | Exploration & Modeling | Python, Stats, pandas, PyTorch | Trained models, insights |
| **ML Engineer** | Deployment & Optimization | MLOps, Kubernetes, TensorFlow | Serving inference APIs |
| **AI Engineer** | Integration & Experience | TypeScript, LangChain, APIs | End-to-end AI applications |

---

## 🧠 Analogy
Think of a **band**:
- Data Scientists compose the melody (the model).  
- ML Engineers handle the sound system (deployment).  
- AI Engineers perform live for the audience (users).  

Generative AI makes the band improvisational — you can combine pre-trained models with code to create something new on the fly.

---

## 🧩 Today’s Lesson Outcomes
✅ Recognize how traditional roles fit into the GenAI landscape.  
✅ Understand how to simulate collaboration in code.  
✅ Use LangChain + OpenAI to dynamically explain complex ideas.

---

## 🛠 Run the Examples

### 1️⃣ Vanilla TypeScript
Simulate the three roles working together.
```bash
npm run dev:day2:vanilla
```

### 2️⃣ LangChain Framework
Let an LLM describe the roles in its own words.
```bash
npm run dev:day2:framework
```

---

## 💡 Why Two Versions?
| Approach | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| **Vanilla TypeScript** | Understand logic flow without abstractions. |
| **LangChain Framework** | Experience real LLM interaction for education and prototyping. |
